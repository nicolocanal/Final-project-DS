FILES DESCRIPTION

1) Ambulance calls cleaning (Step 1): 

In this file I started cleaning the ambulance calls dataset (that I renamed Den_Haag_calls). From this dataset I created four different 
sub-dataframes for every year (2017,2018,2019,2020) that are called like Calls_'Year'. Knowing that we are going to exclude 2020 I did not 
save this last dataframe. Hence, you can find three cleaned dataframes: Calls_2017, Calls_2018, Calls_2019

2) Geo-visualisations (Step 1): 

In this file I started looking into some geo-visualisations of our ambulance calls. In the end I tried to consider only the 
calls that fall within the 'geographic boundaries' of Den Haag. 


NOTE: All the code you will find is usually justified inside the notebooks.
